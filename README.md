# airodor-wifi
This repository provides two [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) packages
1. airodor_wifi_api: this package provides a simple python api to communicate with the limodor/limot airodor wifi module
2. airodor_web_app: this packages provides a simple flas web app as frontend to the airodor_wifi_api. :warning: This module holds a poetry tool dependency to the airodor_wifi_api. This is currently a workaround to have both packages in one repository and will be resolved in the future.
